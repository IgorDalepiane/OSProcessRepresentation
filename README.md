# OSProcessRepresentation

This is a work done for the discipline of Operational Systems (OS), 4th semester of the Software Engineering course, Unipampa campus Alegrete.

# Description

Implement a process representation (from an operating system perspective)

- Create a data structure that represents the process.
- Implement a process manager, which "simulates" the possible states of a process.
- Implement different process scheduling policies. Consider that for each process there are associated pertinent information (Process priorities 1 through 20 and mechanisms for increasing and decreasing priorities).
Each running process can be stopped by preemption or by system call (choose this at random). Decrease the priority if the process is interrupted by preemption and increase the priority otherwise.
